[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Many people asked for some special mod for Halloween, and here is my answer ^^
As you will probably notice if you already played on the City Bay map, this mod is hugely inspired by the graveyard of this map. The first thing I did was to find and reproduce the darkness effect and the ambient souds used in the graveyard to apply them everywhere.
Then I created the Slender Goat using the characteristics of the one present in the graveyard (basically a Ripped Goat crossed with a Space Goat). Then I added a custom AI that reuse some of the behaviours of the Zombies and add some brand new stuff like the ability to teleport.
As I couldn't reproduce the "move only when out of view" behaviour, I tried to find a mechanism that could work in third person view and ended up with something really similar to the AI of Minecraft's Endermens.
Also I replaced the "game over" sequence when you lost in the original game by a custom "broken mind" animation that makes you lost completely the control of your body.
